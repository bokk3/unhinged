# Proposal 10: Worst UI/UX

## Concept

A showcase of the absolute worst design practices all in one interface.

## Mechanics

- **Navigation**: Hamburger menu that runs away.
- **Forms**: Phone number input is a slider. Date of birth is a dropdown of every day since 1900.
- **Colors**: Neon green text on a neon red background.
- **Popups**: Modals that spawn other modals when closed.
- **Scroll**: Scrolljacking that reverses direction randomly.

## "Unhinged" Factor

A torture chamber for designers and a test of endurance for users.
