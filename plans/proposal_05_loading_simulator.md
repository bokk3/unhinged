# Proposal 05: Loading Simulator

## Concept

A game? A test of patience? It's just loading bars.

## Mechanics

- **The Game**: You watch a loading bar fill up.
- **Glitches**: It gets to 99% and stalls. It goes backwards. It changes color.
- **Interaction**: You have to "fix" the loading bar by clicking on it, shaking the window, or blowing into the microphone to make it move.
- **Levels**: Level 2 is two loading bars. Level 3 is a spinning wheel.

## "Unhinged" Factor

It gamifies the most annoying part of digital life without offering any reward.
