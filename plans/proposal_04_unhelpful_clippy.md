# Proposal 04: Unhelpful AI Assistant

## Concept

An AI chatbot (like Clippy but worse) that pops up constantly to offer confidently incorrect advice or useless facts.

## Mechanics

- **Trigger**: Pops up on every click or scroll.
- **Advice**:
  - User is typing a password -> "Did you know 'password123' is easy to remember? You should use that."
  - User is reading -> "I see you're reading. Would you like me to summarize this into a wrong conclusion?"
- **Persistence**: The "Close" button moves or is actually a "Tell me more" button.

## "Unhinged" Factor

It mimics the annoyance of bad assistants but dials it up to active sabotage.
