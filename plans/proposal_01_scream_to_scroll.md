# Proposal 01: Scream to Scroll

## Concept

A standard content website (maybe a long article or a social feed) where the scroll mechanism is entirely controlled by the volume of the user's microphone input.

## Mechanics

- **Silence**: The page stays still.
- **Whisper**: Slow scroll down.
- **Screaming**: Fast scroll down.
- **Sudden Loud Noise**: Jump to bottom.
- **Reverse**: To scroll up, you must sing a high-pitched note.

## "Unhinged" Factor

Users have to literally scream at their computer to consume content. Imagine using this in a library or office.
