# Proposal 09: Is It Cake?

## Concept

An AI that analyzes uploaded photos and randomly guesses if they are cake or not.

## Mechanics

- **Upload**: User uploads a photo of a dog, a building, a person.
- **Analysis**: Fake "Scanning..." animation.
- **Result**: Randomly returns "IT IS CAKE" or "NOT CAKE".
- **Proof**: If it says it's cake, it overlays a video of a knife cutting into the object (using generic green screen footage).

## "Unhinged" Factor

Gaslighting users into thinking their loved ones might be hyper-realistic baked goods.
