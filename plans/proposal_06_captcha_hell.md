# Proposal 06: Captcha Hell

## Concept

A blog or news site where every single paragraph is locked behind a Captcha.

## Mechanics

- **Granularity**: You read the headline. To read the first sentence, solve a Captcha.
- **Types**: Not just "select traffic lights".
  - "Select all the pixels that contain a feeling of existential dread."
  - "Type the characters you see (in reverse alphabetical order)."
  - "Solve this differential equation."
- **Failure**: If you fail, the page reloads and you lose your place.

## "Unhinged" Factor

It turns the act of reading into a security interrogation.
