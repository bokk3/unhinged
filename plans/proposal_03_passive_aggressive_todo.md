# Proposal 03: Passive Aggressive To-Do

## Concept

A To-Do list application that judges you for your tasks and your speed of completion.

## Mechanics

- **Task Entry**: If you type "Buy milk", it changes it to "Buy milk (because you're too lazy to make your own almond milk)".
- **Delays**: If a task sits for more than an hour, the app sends browser notifications like "Still haven't done it? Wow."
- **Completion**: Checking off a task results in a sarcastic "Finally." or "Do you want a medal?"
- **Deletion**: You can't delete tasks, only mark them as "I gave up".

## "Unhinged" Factor

It takes the helpfulness of a productivity tool and replaces it with the personality of a disappointed parent.
