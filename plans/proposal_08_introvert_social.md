# Proposal 08: Introvert Social Media

## Concept

A social network where you can't interact with anyone.

## Mechanics

- **Feed**: You see posts from others.
- **No Likes**: The like button is there, but clicking it does nothing.
- **No Comments**: The comment box is disabled with a placeholder "Better not to say anything."
- **No DMs**: You can view profiles, but there is no message button.
- **Ghosting**: If you try to post, it simulates a "network error" and deletes your draft.

## "Unhinged" Factor

It provides the voyeurism of social media without the anxiety of interaction, but also without the dopamine of validation.
