# Proposal 02: Cursor Chase

## Concept

A simple form or landing page where the "Submit" or "Buy Now" button actively evades the user's cursor.

## Mechanics

- **Evasion**: As the cursor gets within 50px of the button, it moves away in the opposite direction.
- **Speed**: The button moves slightly faster than the average mouse movement.
- **Taunts**: The button displays tooltips like "Too slow!" or "Almost had it!"
- **Trap**: If the user manages to corner it, the button splits into two smaller buttons.

## "Unhinged" Factor

Pure frustration. The core interaction of the web (clicking) is made impossible.
