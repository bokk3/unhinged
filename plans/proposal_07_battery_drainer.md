# Proposal 07: Battery Drainer

## Concept

A website designed specifically to drain the user's battery as fast as possible.

## Mechanics

- **Visuals**: Intense, high-framerate WebGL shaders.
- **Background**: Mining a fake cryptocurrency (or just calculating pi) in the background to max out CPU usage.
- **Brightness**: Requests permission to maximize screen brightness.
- **Vibration**: Constant haptic feedback on mobile devices.

## "Unhinged" Factor

It's a utility tool for the one specific use case of "I need my phone to die right now."
