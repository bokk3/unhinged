## 🎭 The Projects

| Project                        | Description                                                                                                | Chaos Level |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 🗣️ **Scream to Scroll**        | Control page scrolling with your voice volume. The louder you scream, the faster you scroll.               | 🔥🔥🔥      |
| 🎯 **Cursor Chase**            | A button that actively evades your cursor, taunts you, and splits when cornered.                           | 🔥🔥🔥🔥    |
| 📝 **Passive Aggressive Todo** | A todo list that judges your tasks and gives sarcastic feedback. No delete, only "I gave up".              | 🔥🔥🔥      |
| ⏳ **Loading Simulator**       | Watch loading bars stall at 99%, go backwards, and require clicking to fix. 9 levels of suffering.         | 🔥🔥🔥🔥    |
| 🔐 **Captcha Hell**            | Every paragraph locked behind impossible captchas: philosophy questions, emotion grids, color tests.       | 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥  |
| 🍰 **Is It Cake?**             | Upload any image and our "AI" randomly decides if it's cake. Includes knife cutting animation.             | 🔥🔥        |
| 👻 **Introvert Social**        | A social network with no interaction. Likes fail, posts get ghosted, comments are disabled.                | 🔥🔥🔥      |
| 📎 **Unhelpful AI**            | Like Clippy but worse. Pops up constantly with bad advice. Close button runs away from you.                | 🔥🔥🔥🔥    |
| 🔋 **Battery Drainer**         | GPU particle torture + fake crypto mining to drain your battery ASAP. For when you need your phone to die. | 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥  |
| 💀 **Worst UI/UX Ever**        | Every bad design pattern in one place: fleeing buttons, modal hell, chaos forms, drunk scrolling.          | 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥  |
